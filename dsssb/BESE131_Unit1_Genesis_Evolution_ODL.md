# Unit 2: Theoretical Foundations of ODL

## 2.1 Key Theories of Distance Education

### 1. Theory of Independent Study (Charles Wedemeyer, 1971)

- Learner is **autonomous** and **independent**
- Learning can happen at **any place, any time**
- Focus on **learner-centered** education
- Six characteristics:
  1. Greater student responsibility
  2. Widely available courses
  3. Effective mix of media
  4. Adaptation to individual differences
  5. Variety of start times
  6. Student-centered evaluation

### 2. Theory of Industrialization (Otto Peters, 1967)

- Distance education as **industrialized form** of teaching-learning
- Characteristics similar to industrial production:
  - **Division of labor**
  - **Mechanization**
  - **Mass production**
  - **Standardization**
  - **Quality control**
- Course development = Manufacturing process

### 3. Theory of Transactional Distance (Michael Moore, 1983)

**Key Concept**: Distance is not just physical, but **psychological and communicational**

**Three Key Variables**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           TRANSACTIONAL DISTANCE                │
│                                                 │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────┐ │
│  │  DIALOGUE   │  │  STRUCTURE  │  │ LEARNER │ │
│  │             │  │             │  │ AUTONOMY│ │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────┘ │
│                                                 │
│  More Dialogue = Less Transactional Distance    │
│  More Structure = More Transactional Distance   │
│  More Autonomy = Can Handle More Distance       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Dialogue**: Interaction between teacher and learner
- **Structure**: Rigidity/flexibility of course design
- **Learner Autonomy**: Self-directedness of learner

### 4. Theory of Interaction (Börje Holmberg, 1983)

- **Guided Didactic Conversation** concept
- Learning materials should have **conversational style**
- Creates sense of **personal relationship**
- Seven postulates of guided didactic conversation:
  1. Feelings of personal relationship promote motivation
  2. Such feelings are conveyed by well-developed SLMs
  3. Intellectual pleasure leads to motivation
  4. Clear learning objectives promote achievement
  5. Learning is facilitated by constant communication
  6. Deep approach to learning is promoted by dialogue
  7. Emotional involvement promotes success

### 5. Pask's Conversation Theory (Gordon Pask, 1976)

- Learning happens through **conversations**
- Two levels:
  - **Learning how to learn** (deutero-learning)
  - **Learning subject matter** (proto-learning)
- Emphasizes importance of **interaction and dialogue**

## 2.2 Comparison of Major Theories

| Theory | Theorist | Focus | Key Concept |
|--------|----------|-------|-------------|
| Independent Study | Wedemeyer | Learner autonomy | Freedom & Independence |
| Industrialization | Peters | System design | Mass production model |
| Transactional Distance | Moore | Communication gap | Dialogue + Structure + Autonomy |
| Interaction | Holmberg | Empathy | Guided didactic conversation |
