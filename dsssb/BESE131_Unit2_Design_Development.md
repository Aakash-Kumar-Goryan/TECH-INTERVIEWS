# Unit 5: Designing Self-Learning Materials (SLMs)

## 5.1 What are SLMs?

**Self-Learning Materials** = Instructional materials enabling independent learning without teacher supervision.

### Characteristics of SLMs

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Self-explanatory | Clear without external help |
| Self-contained | All info included |
| Self-directed | Learner controls pace |
| Self-motivating | Engaging content |
| Self-evaluating | Built-in assessments |

## 5.2 Key Instructional Design Models

### ADDIE Model (Most Important)

```
ANALYZE → DESIGN → DEVELOP → IMPLEMENT → EVALUATE
```

| Phase | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| **Analyze** | Learner needs, goals, constraints |
| **Design** | Objectives, strategies, assessment plan |
| **Develop** | Create content, materials, media |
| **Implement** | Deliver instruction |
| **Evaluate** | Formative & summative assessment |
