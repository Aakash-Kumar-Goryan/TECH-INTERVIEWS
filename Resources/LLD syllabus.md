## General Tips for the 2 Weeks

- **Prioritize Understanding:** Grasp the "why" behind principles and patterns, not just definitions  
- **Practice Regularly:** Consistency is key to developing LLD skills  
- **Mock Interviews:** Simulate real interview scenarios to build confidence  
- **Review Solutions:** Study multiple approaches, including open-source references  
- **Discuss Trade-offs:** Be ready to explain the pros and cons of your design decisions  
- **Communicate Effectively:** Clearly verbalize your thought process and ask clarifying questions  
- **Manage Time Wisely:** Focus on the most impactful areas and simulate interview time constraints  


### ⚠️ Important Note
This is a **condensed** and **intense** plan. While doable, two weeks is a short timeframe to *master* LLD for senior-level interviews at companies like Google or Uber (as per Design Gurus). Extend the preparation timeline if possible for deeper understanding and more robust practice.
