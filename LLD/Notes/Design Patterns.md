# 🌳 Design Pattern Classification Tree

## 1. Creational Patterns 🏗️
> Focus on object creation mechanisms

- **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method** - Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Abstract Factory** - Produces families of related objects.
- **Builder** - Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype** - Creates new objects by cloning existing ones.

---

## 2. Structural Patterns 🧱
> Deal with object composition and structure

- **Adapter** - Converts one interface into another.
- **Bridge** - Decouples abstraction from implementation.
- **Composite** - Composes objects into tree structures.
- **Decorator** - Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Facade** - Simplifies a complex subsystem with a unified interface.
- **Flyweight** - Reduces memory usage by sharing common data.
- **Proxy** - Controls access to another object.

---

## 3. Behavioral Patterns 🧠
> Concerned with communication between objects

- **Observer** - Notifies dependent objects of changes.
- **Strategy** - Allows selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- **Command** - Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Iterator** - Sequentially accesses elements of a collection.
- **Mediator** - Centralizes complex communications.
- **State** - Allows an object to alter its behavior based on internal state.
- **Template Method** - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm.
- **Chain of Responsibility** - Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
- **Interpreter** - Implements a grammar for a language.
- **Visitor** - Adds operations to objects without changing their classes.
- **Memento** - Captures and restores object state.
