# 🎭 Interview Role-Play: Exact Phrasing Cheat Sheet

**Goal**: Avoid "dismissive" or "silent" signals by using these specific guardrails.
**Instructions**: Read this once, then reuse verbatim.

---

## 1️⃣ Start of a Big / Messy Problem (CSV, Logs)

**Say this in the first 2–3 minutes:**
> "This looks like a large problem, so I’ll first sketch the structure, then implement the happy path, and narrate edge cases as we go."

* **Why**: Sets expectations, protects you from "didn't finish".

---

## 2️⃣ When Interviewer Gives a Hint

**The Three-Step Response (Always):**

1. **Acknowledge**: "That’s a good point."
2. **Restate**: "You’re suggesting we handle X before Y / simplify this part."
3. **Decide**: "I’ll adjust my approach accordingly."
    * *OR*: "I’ll stick with this approach for now because of time, but your suggestion would be better in production."

---

## 3️⃣ When You *Don't* Want to Follow a Hint

**Do not go silent.** Say:
> "I see why that would help. Given the time, I’m choosing to continue with this approach, but I’d revisit it immediately afterward."

* **Result**: Turns ❌ "dismissive" into ✅ "intentional tradeoff".

---

## 4️⃣ Checking Docs / Recalling Syntax

**Never apologize.** Say:
> "I don’t want to get the syntax wrong — let me quickly confirm this."

* *OR*: "I’ll write the logic assuming this helper exists; syntax can be fixed easily."

---

## 5️⃣ Time Running Out + Unfinished Parts

**Critical Must-Say:**
> "There are two remaining parts: validation and error handling. I won’t finish coding them, but here’s exactly how I’d do them."
*(Then explain verbally. Interviewers expect this.)*

---

## 6️⃣ Feeling Slow / Code Getting Big

**Reframe immediately:**
> "I’m optimizing for correctness and clarity over completeness."

---

## 7️⃣ Question: "Anything else you'd improve?"

**Standard Answer:**
> "Yes — I’d refactor this parsing into a separate helper, add tests for edge cases, and improve error reporting."

---

## 8️⃣ Approached is Challenged

**Signal Collaboration:**
> "That’s fair. Let me walk through my reasoning, and I’m open to adjusting if I’m missing something."

---

## 9️⃣ Closing
>
> "Thanks — I enjoyed the problem. It felt very close to real production work."

---

## 🧠 Mental Model Reminder

**Evaluated On:**

* Scope management
* Collaboration
* Tradeoff explanation

**NOT Evaluated On:**

* Typing speed / finishing everything

## 🔁 Daily Practice (5 mins)

* Pick one coding problem.
* Solve only 70%.
* **Practice saying these sentences out loud.**
