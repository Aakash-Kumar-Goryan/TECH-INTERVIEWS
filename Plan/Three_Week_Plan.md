# 3-Week Interview Prep Plan

## 🎯 Overall Goals

By the end of 3 weeks you should feel:

- "C++ disappears when I code"
- "I can structure big problems without panic"
- "I can talk LLD/HLD calmly without over-designing"
- "I know what to code vs what to explain"

## 📅 WEEK 1 — Language Fluency + Big-Code Control

**(Most important week)**

### C++ (Coding / DSA) — 40–50 mins/day

**Goal**: Zero hesitation on basics.

**Focus ONLY on:**

- `getline(cin, line)` + EOF loop
- manual string split / trim
- `unordered_map`, `vector`
- simple loops (no clever STL)

**Daily Drill (20–25 mins):**

- Parse input from stdin
- Split strings
- Group data in maps
- Print output
- *👉 Think: logs, CSVs, transactions.*

**Big-code Habit (10 mins/day):**

- Practice this pattern out loud: **"I’ll sketch structure first → implement core → narrate rest"**
- You are training problem control, not speed.

### Java (LLD) — 20–30 mins/day

**Goal**: Comfort, not perfection

**Revise:**

- classes vs interfaces
- constructors
- immutability
- basic composition

**Practice:**

- Write small models, not full systems: `User`, `Order`, `Subscription`
- Keep methods minimal.
- *👉 Don’t code everything — explain relationships.*

### 🛑 One Non-Negotiable Habit (Week 1)

Every session, practice saying:
> "I’ll implement the happy path and describe edge cases."
*(This directly fixes Stripe feedback)*

---

## 📅 WEEK 2 — LLD + Communication (Stripe → Indeed → Roku style)

### Java (LLD focus) — 45–60 mins/day

**Goal**: Clean object thinking, not patterns overload

**Practice only these LLD problems:**

- Parking Lot (basic)
- Rate Limiter
- Subscription system
- Notification service

**What to practice:**

- responsibilities per class
- method naming
- avoiding god classes
- stating assumptions clearly

**Say explicitly:**
> "I’m optimizing for clarity, not completeness."
*(That sentence alone earns points.)*

### C++ (Coding) — 20–30 mins/day

**Keep muscle memory alive:**

- 1 small problem/day
- Focus on correctness + explanation

**Avoid:**

- new algorithms
- competitive tricks

### HLD (Light) — 15 mins/day

**Goal**: Calm system thinking

**Practice explaining (not drawing):**

- components
- data flow
- failure modes
- tradeoffs

**Example phrasing:**
> "I’ll start simple and evolve if requirements grow."
*(That’s Stripe/Indeed/Roku aligned.)*

---

## 📅 WEEK 3 — Interview Simulation + Polish

### Mixed Mock Style (3–4 days)

**Simulate real interview behavior:**

**Coding Mock (C++)**

- Biggish problem
- Stop coding at 70%
- Explain rest verbally
- **Train yourself to stop typing intentionally.**

**LLD Mock (Java)**

- Talk first
- Write only class skeletons
- Explain interactions
- **If you feel urge to over-code → stop and explain.**

### Explicit Collaboration Practice (Daily, 5 mins)

Practice saying:

- "That’s a good point — let me adjust"
- "I see why you’re suggesting that"
- "Given time, I’ll prioritize X and describe Y"
*(This directly addresses the "dismissive" perception.)*

---

## 🧠 What NOT to study in these 3 weeks

- ❌ Advanced DP
- ❌ Segment trees
- ❌ Fancy design patterns
- ❌ Regex mastery
- ❌ Competitive programming tricks
*(Low ROI for your profile.)*

## 🧭 How this maps to companies

- **Indeed** → You’re already well aligned; this polish makes you strong
- **Roku** → Very good fit after Week 2
- **Google** → Schedule after Week 3 if you want
- **Stripe reapply** → After 6–12 months, this polish + confidence helps a lot

## 🧠 Final Mindset

**You don’t need to:**

- type faster
- know more algorithms
- become someone else

**You need to:**

- control scope, show structure, and communicate intent

*This plan does exactly that.*
