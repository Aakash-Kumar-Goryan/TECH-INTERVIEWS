# High-Level Design (HLD) Topics for SDE2/3 Interviews (Google, Microsoft, Amazon)

## 1. System Design Fundamentals
- Requirements gathering (functional & non-functional)
- API design (REST, gRPC, GraphQL basics)
- Scalability, reliability, availability, maintainability
- CAP theorem, consistency models
- Latency vs throughput

## 2. Core Components & Patterns
- Load balancers (L4/L7)
- Caching (client/server, CDN, cache invalidation)
- Databases (SQL vs NoSQL, sharding, replication, partitioning)
- Indexing, search, and query optimization
- Message queues, pub/sub, event-driven architecture (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub)
- Microservices vs monoliths
- Service discovery
- Rate limiting, throttling
- API gateways

## 3. Storage & Data Management
- File storage vs object storage
- Blob stores (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- Data modeling, schema design
- Data consistency, eventual consistency
- Data backup, archival, disaster recovery

## 4. Scalability & Performance
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- Stateless vs stateful services
- CDN, edge computing
- Partitioning, consistent hashing
- Caching strategies (LRU, LFU, TTL)
- Performance bottleneck identification

## 5. Reliability & Fault Tolerance
- Redundancy, failover, replication
- Health checks, circuit breakers
- Graceful degradation
- Monitoring, alerting, observability
- Chaos engineering basics

## 6. Security & Privacy
- Authentication & authorization (OAuth, JWT, SSO)
- Encryption (at rest, in transit)
- Secure API design
- Rate limiting, DDoS protection
- Auditing, logging, compliance

## 7. Design Case Studies
- URL shortener
- Distributed cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
- Messaging system (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack)
- Event streaming platform (e.g., Apache Kafka, Kinesis)
- File storage/sharing (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive)
- News feed/timeline (e.g., Facebook, Twitter)
- Real-time chat (e.g., Messenger, Slack)
- Video streaming (e.g., YouTube, Netflix)
- Search engine (e.g., Google Search)
- E-commerce backend (e.g., Amazon)
- Ride sharing (e.g., Uber, Lyft)

## 8. Cloud & DevOps Basics
- Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) basics
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Monitoring/logging tools (Prometheus, ELK, Datadog)

## 9. Miscellaneous
- API versioning
- Backward/forward compatibility
- Blue/green & canary deployments
- Feature flags
- Cost optimization
