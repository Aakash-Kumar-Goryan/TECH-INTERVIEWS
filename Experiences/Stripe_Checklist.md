# Stripe Prep Checklist

## 🚀 ROUND 1 — Core Coding (Clean, Finishable Problem)

**What Stripe is checking**

- Can you solve a realistic problem end-to-end?
- Can you write readable, correct code?
- Can you handle edge cases without overengineering?

**Typical problems**

- String / log parsing
- Grouping with hash maps
- Time-window logic
- Business rules

**Prep checklist**

- [ ] Practice string scanning (find, substr, indices)
- [ ] Practice group-by patterns (map<string, vector<...>>)
- [ ] Maintain clear invariants in loops
- [ ] Name variables semantically (not i, x, tmp)
- [ ] Finish base solution before optimizing

**What to say out loud**
> “I’ll start with a simple, correct solution and handle edge cases.”

## 🧠 ROUND 2 — Coding + Reasoning (Follow-ups Heavy)

**What Stripe is checking**

- Can you adapt calmly?
- Can you explain tradeoffs?
- Can you think beyond the first solution?

**Expected follow-ups**

- “How would you test this?”
- “What if input grows?”
- “What assumptions did you make?”
- “What would you refactor?”

**Prep checklist**

- [ ] Practice 30-second solution summaries
- [ ] Practice stating assumptions explicitly
- [ ] Be ready to discuss testing verbally
- [ ] Be comfortable saying “I’d refactor X if we had time”
- [ ] Don’t defend first solution aggressively

**What to say out loud**
> “Given more time, I’d improve X, but this solves the core requirement.”

## 🏗️ ROUND 3 — Practical System Design (Light HLD)

**What Stripe is checking**

- Can you design a small real system?
- Can you reason about failures?
- Can you communicate clearly?

**Typical systems**

- Rate limiter
- Notification system
- Data ingestion pipeline
- Reconciliation job
- Feature flags

**Prep checklist**

- [ ] Start with requirements clarification
- [ ] Identify core components
- [ ] Describe data flow
- [ ] Mention failure modes
- [ ] Discuss tradeoffs, not perfection

**What to say out loud**
> “I’ll keep this simple and evolve it if requirements grow.”

## 🧑💼 ROUND 4 — Manager / Behavioral

**What Stripe is checking**

- Ownership
- Communication
- Ambiguity handling
- Collaboration style

**Common questions**

- “Tell me about a tough decision”
- “How do you handle ambiguity?”
- “How do you work with PMs?”
- “How do you ensure code quality?”

**Prep checklist**

- [ ] Prepare 2–3 real stories
- [ ] Emphasize impact and learning
- [ ] Show comfort with ambiguity
- [ ] Mention documentation & communication
- [ ] Stay calm and conversational

**What to say out loud**
> “I focus on clarity, ownership, and aligning with stakeholders.”
